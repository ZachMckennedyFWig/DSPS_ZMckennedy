# Homework 6

## What was this homework about? 
Fitting historical temperature data using Gaussian Processes to interpolate to day long intervals instead of month long intervals, and to optimize the data and try to predict future temperature data. 

## What was the hardest part? 
The hardest part for me was making the optimizer, and I still think that I did it wrong but I'm not sure. It took a very long time to get L2 Optimization to run and the results don't look that different from the initial guess that we just got from trial and error. 

## What was the easiest part? 
The easiest part was loading in the data and flattening it since it's just very straighforwards. 

## Collaboration: 
I worked on this with Jensen Gaither, he did the beginning section up to the Gaussian Process, then we worked together to finish that part and I did the optimization and final visualization alone.
