# Homework 7

## What was this homework about? 
Using different methods of clustering (k-means, hierarchical, DBSCAN, ) to explore how different types of clustering behaves on the same data, as well as using t-SNE and UMAP projections. 

## What was the hardest part? 
The hardest part for me was trying to get the DBSCAN clustering to even come remotely close to the results we got in K-means. With reasonable hyperparameters and limiting the number of outliers I could have, I was only able to get 2 clusters that didn't really match what we saw in any other clustering methods. I'm still not entirely sure if I was doing something wrong or if this is just not a very applicable situation to use DBSCAN.

## What was the easiest part? 
The easiest part was the Hierarchical clustering in my opinion because you could see exactly what it was doing which really helped understanding how it was working behing the scenes. It also was able to get a similar result to the K-means clustering. 

## Collaboration: 
I worked on this with Jensen Gaither, he did the beginning and K-Means clustering, I did the DBSCAN, Hierarchical clustering and everything after what he did.
