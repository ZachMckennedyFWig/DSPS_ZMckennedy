# Homework 4

This homework explored Uncertainties and Dark matter, specifically reproducing the work found in [this paper](https://academic.oup.com/pasj/article/67/4/75/1536635). The outcome is to show that the uncertainties and breakdown of Conventional Newtonian Physics breaks down due to the presence of Dark Matter in galexies.

I think that the hardest part of this assignment for me was properly creating the error plots with all the information that was required in them. 

I really enjoyed going through it again for the Milky way section and just being able to reuse all the functions that i had made in the earlier parts!!

I worked on this with Jensen Gaither, Jensen did the beginning section of data collection and calculating the size and error of M31, I did the luminousity filtering, data visualization, and copy and pasted the earlier parts for the Milky Way section.
