# Homework 10

## What was this homework about? 
This homework explores creating Physically Informed Neural Networks to solve Burger's equations. 

## What was the hardest part? 
The hardest part in my opinion was creating the complete loss function since i didn't fully understand what that was going into this assignment. I also struggled with the activation functions later in the notebook because while ReLu gave me promising results in the initial NN's, I needed to swithc to tanh to get any accuracy at all later.

## What was the easiest part? 
Creating the models was very simple and its amazing that it's become as easy as it is to create such powerful things. 

## Collaboration: 
I worked on this with Jensen Gaither, he did the beginning model with l2 loss and i completed the rest of the notebook with complete loss and changing the learning rates to more accurately represent the solution to Burger's equations.
