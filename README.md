# DSPS_ZMckennedy
Repository for DSPS 2023 class (PHYS461)

What is the reason why you decided to take the class? 
  I chose to take this class because I have an interest in Machine Learning and data science for use in robotics/remote sensing. I have also taken a Machine Learning course from Stanford by Dr. Andrew Ng that really fueled my passion for the subject. 

What do you hope to learn the most? 
  I really hope to have a better understanding of data processing through clustering and higher-order regression algorithms. I would really like to learn about Locality-sensitive hashing since I've seen it used but never fully grasped it. 

What are the strengths in your background or character that you thin will help you in the class? 
  I have done a lot of programming even though I am a mechanical engineer, I am really interested in learning new ideas, and machine learning/ai is a super interesting topic globally right now.
