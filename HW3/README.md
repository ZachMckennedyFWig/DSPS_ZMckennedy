# Homework 3

This homework covered a bunch of topics including: Data injestion, data correction, data filtering, KS tests and some magical Harmonic Mean rescaling. The main goal of this paper was replicating parts of the the ["Statistical Tests fo Scaling In the Inter-Event Times of Earthquakes In California"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0910.0055.pdf) Paper by Corral. 

By far the hardest part for me was the last problem since I am not really familiar with the math they used to scale the differently rescaled datasets so I think a lot of that code was patched together (and potentially wrong!). 

I really enjoyed the data correction part though since it was a fun challenge finding and fixing the errors for the pandas dataset. 

I worked on this with Jensen Gaither, I did from the beginning to the "Select Valuable Data" section as well as the very last problem with the CDF distributions and K-S test tables, Jensen did everything in between that.
