# Homework 9

## What was this homework about? 
This homework was using a dataset from kaggle, specifically the higgs boson search, where we had to classify the signal using both random forests and gradient boosted classification. 

## What was the hardest part? 
The hardest part for me was figuring out if i correctly set the depth of the tree to avoid overfitting. The scores on both the training and test sets looked good but i'm not confident enough to say that i did it right. 

## What was the easiest part? 
The easiest part was just running the models since it was basically just a single line of code.  

## Collaboration: 
I worked on this with Jensen Gaither.
