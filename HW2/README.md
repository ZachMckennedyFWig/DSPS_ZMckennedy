# Homework 2

This homework covered some introductory topics of probability and statistics with 2 collab notebooks. 

The first one covered creating Chi2 distributions to help understand how Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions worked and how to calculate the means of Chi2 distributions of the 3rd degree of freedom.

The second assignment covered was evaluating the central limit theorem and the law of large numbers of different types of distributions. 

I worked on this with Jensen Gaither, I did the first assignments collab notebook and Jensen did the 2nd assignments collab notebook.
