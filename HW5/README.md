# Homework 4

## What was this homework about? 
This homework explored fitting models using different models such as Linear Regression and MCMC. 

## What was the hardest part? 
The hardest part of this for me was debugging the plots since I was accidentally using the same variable names in some parts, which made crazy graphs that made no sense so I had to comb through all the early cells to debug what I was doing wrong. 

## What was the easiest part? 
The easiest part was probably the Data aquisition and the MCMC since we've gotten plenty of help in class with both of those things so it was really just a matter of copy and pasting, then interpretating. 

## Collaboration: 
I worked on this with Jensen Gaither, he did the beginning section up to the Chi2 function and I did everything after that to the end.
