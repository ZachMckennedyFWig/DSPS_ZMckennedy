# Homework 4

This homework explored 

I think that the hardest part of this assignment for me was properly creating the error plots with all the information that was required in them. 

I really enjoyed going through it again for the Milky way section and just being able to reuse all the functions that i had made in the earlier parts!!

I worked on this with Jensen Gaither, Jensen did the beginning section of data collection and calculating the size and error of M31, I did the luminousity filtering, data visualization, and copy and pasted the earlier parts for the Milky Way section.
