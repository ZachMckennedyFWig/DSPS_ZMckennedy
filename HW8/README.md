This is the good plot that I chose, taken from Pg 6 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.13015.pdf) about morality risk scores for critical care patients. This is a good example of a well made graph because of the limited chart junk, clear representation of the data, aligned scales for the accuracy and precisions, and no dublicated information.  

**Bad Plot:** \

This is the bad plot that I chose, taken from Pg 23 of [this paper](from https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2301/2301.00680.pdf). This figure contains a plot on the right that is supposed to represent the concentration of companies in the 3D printing market. However, it is just a color map with a gradient of green, yellow, and red with no measurement scale making it pretty ambiguous. 3D printing is marked on this graph with a giant arrow pointed at the orange section of the gradient, which doesn't really represent anything. This graph could be improved by including a metric for measuring market concentration, a better color gradient, and potentially using other similar markets to make some kind of comparison of current manufacturing methods. I also think a color map is the wrong choice to represent this data, if it is just a single market, like 3D printing, you don't need a graph at all, and if they wanted to make a comparison between different markets a bar graph would be a better way to show the concentration of companies in the market.
