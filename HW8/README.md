# Part 1

**Good Plot:**

This is the good plot that I chose, taken from Pg 6 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.13015.pdf) about morality risk scores for critical care patients. This is a good example of a well made graph because of the limited chart junk, clear representation of the data, aligned scales for the accuracy and precisions, and no dublicated information.  

**Bad Plot:**

This is the bad plot that I chose, taken from Pg 23 of [this paper](from https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2301/2301.00680.pdf). This figure contains a plot on the right that is supposed to represent the concentration of companies in the 3D printing market. However, it is just a color map with a gradient of green, yellow, and red with no measurement scale making it pretty ambiguous. 3D printing is marked on this graph with a giant arrow pointed at the orange section of the gradient, which doesn't really represent anything. This graph could be improved by including a metric for measuring market concentration, a better color gradient, and potentially using other similar markets to make some kind of comparison of current manufacturing methods. I also think a color map is the wrong choice to represent this data, if it is just a single market, like 3D printing, you don't need a graph at all, and if they wanted to make a comparison between different markets a bar graph would be a better way to show the concentration of companies in the market.

# Part 2

**My Bad Plot:**

This is a poor example of a plot because of the formatting creating ugly and unclear data. The colors of the points seem a little ambiguous, since they weren't specified, and since the data is so tightly packed the points overlap each other with full opacity. On top of this, the axis labels don't specify units. To fix this I am going to rewrite the plotting function to correct all these issues.

**My Improved Plot:**

This is an improved version of that plot because; the figure is scaled better, the legend is labeled more accurately, there is a plot title and accurate axis labels, and the data is more distinct colors with lower opacity so overlapping points can be identified.
